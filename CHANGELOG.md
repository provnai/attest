## [v0.1.0] - 2026-03-05

### ⚓ The Silicon-Rooted Release
This release bridges the gap between cognitive AI and physical machine security, providing hardware-sealed identity and mathematical finality via ZK-STARKs.

### Added
- **Hardware-Sealed Identity**: 
  - Native TPM 2.0 (Linux) via `tss-esapi` and Microsoft CNG (Windows) support for **Industrial Strength** key protection.
  - **No More "Hot Keys"**: Keys are sealed to the Secure Element and never exposed in plaintext.
  - **Deterministic Attribution**: Agent IDs (`aid:...`) are cryptographically derived from hardware, ensuring 1:1 accountability.
- **ZK-STARK Audit Trails (Mathematical Finality)**:
  - **Plonky3 Engine**: High-performance proofs using Goldilocks fields and Two-Adic FRI.
  - **Audit-as-Code**: Generate proofs verifiable by third parties without data exposure.
- **Quantum Undo System**:
  - **Reversible State**: Automatic filesystem snapshots before every `attest exec`.
  - **Instant Rollback**: Revert to known-verified states via `attest quantum undo`.
- **Pure-Go SQLite Bridge**: 100% portable CGO-free storage for seamless deployment anywhere.


## [v0.1.0-alpha] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- **ZK-STARK Integrity**: Integrated **Plonky3** framework with custom `AuditAir` constraint system.
- **Hardware-Backed Identity**: Native TPM2 (Linux) and CNG (Windows) support for sealed identities.
